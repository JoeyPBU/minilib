## Project Plans:
Over time, I hope to expand this simple library with more functions and imrpoved features.
 - Expand Users, including Sign In/Sign Up pages (Currently hardcoded to 1 main user)
 - Expand Search and Filter terms (Immediate: Date Added(Personal Lib), Date Published)
 - Add Progress to books (Unread, Started, Finished)

Run with `npm run dev` for concurrent backend and frontend.
